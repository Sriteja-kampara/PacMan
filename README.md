# PacMan
This project has been done with Oleksii Starov as part of CSE546, Artificial Intelligence in Fall 2013

The PacMan project has originated from UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188 
  http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

The descriptions in details can be found at http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

	Search
		Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. 
		Used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

	Multi-Agent Search 
		Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem.
		Implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

	Reinforcement Learning 
		Implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, 
		applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

	Ghostbusters 
		Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman. 
		Implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

	Classification 
		Implement standard machine learning classification algorithms 
		using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. 
		Extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.
